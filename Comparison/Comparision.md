# Comparision
> **We all know the variours comparision operator like:**

* Greater/less than: a > b, a < b.
* Greater/less than or equals: a >= b, a <= b.
* Equals: a == b, please note the double equality sign == means the    equality test, while a single one a = b means an assignment.
* Not equals: In maths the notation is ≠, but in JavaScript it’s written as a != b.
